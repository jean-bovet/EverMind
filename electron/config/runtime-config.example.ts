/**
 * Runtime Configuration Example
 *
 * This file shows the structure of runtime-config.ts
 * The actual runtime-config.ts is auto-generated at build time from your .env file
 *
 * For development:
 * 1. Ensure you have a .env file in the project root with:
 *    EVERNOTE_CONSUMER_KEY=your_key_here
 *    EVERNOTE_CONSUMER_SECRET=your_secret_here
 *    EVERNOTE_ENDPOINT=https://www.evernote.com
 * 2. Run `npm run build` which will generate runtime-config.ts
 *
 * Note: runtime-config.ts is in .gitignore and should never be committed
